# pikakirjoitus
Method for rapid text input of the Finnish language using keyboard or steno machine

This is a preliminary version of the files that can be imported into Plover. 
Some modifications will have to be made so that it works as described in the handbook.
I will update this version as soon as time allows.  

Pikakirjoitus Suomeksi describes the method to be used.
Sointujen_Sanakirja is a listing of all the chords used in the method.

The RTF file is the one to be imported into Plover.
